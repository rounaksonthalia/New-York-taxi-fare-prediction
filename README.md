# New-York-taxi-fare-prediction
A machine learning project to predict taxi fares in New York City based on trip characteristics (pickup/dropoff locations, date/time, passenger count, etc.). This repository demonstrates end-to-end data pipeline, feature engineering, model training (using XGBoost), and evaluation to build a robust fare‐prediction model.
